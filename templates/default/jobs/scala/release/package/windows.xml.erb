    release.<br>

    Specify a tag that exists on <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala-dist">scala/scala-dist</a>,<br> and that points to a
    version of scala-dist that&apos;s available in one of the repositories listed in repositories-scala-release (see
    scala/jenkins-scripts), and sit back.<p>

    NOTE: the sbt build derives the version to build from the tag, which must thus be of the shape vNN.NN.NN-suffix for
    version NN.NN.NN-suffix<p>

    NOTE2: multiple tags on the same commit will lead to havoc -- you&apos;ll have to create a new commit and tag it (or set
    sbtDistVersionOverride to -Dproject.version=$SCALA_VER)

    The downloads will be available at http://downloads.lightbend.com/scala/$ver/scala-$ver*
