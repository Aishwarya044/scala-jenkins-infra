# only for the initial jenkins config
- name: Copy main jenkins config (it has a predefined admin user with a pre-configured ssh key, used in bootstrap-cli.yml)

    src: config-bootstrap.xml 
    dest: "{{jenkins_home}}/config.xml"
  tags:

  file: path={{jenkins_home}} state=directory recurse=yes owner={{jenkins_user}} group={{jenkins_user}}
  tags:
    - boot_jenkins

- name: Restart jenkins (so that we can log in as admin via cli over ssh)
  service:
    name: jenkins
    state: restarted
